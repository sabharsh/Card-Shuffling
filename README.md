# Components of this repository

1. Card Deck Shuffling Code: This is code that contains the core logic of shuffling a desk of cards by repeating the process of dividing and interleaving a deck multiple times. This segment refers to files: shuffle.h, shuffle.c and test_shuffle.c.

2. Utility Code: This code contains certain operations related to managing card decks that are necessary to perform the process of shuffling. This segment refers to files: utility.h and utility.c.

3. Makefile: This is a file that makes the process of compling and execution easier. Simply run the following two commands to compile and run the code.

                //To compile the code:
                make
                
                //To run the single executable created (test shuffle is the name of the executable file):
                ./test_shuffle
